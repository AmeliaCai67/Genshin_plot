The Divine Damsel of Devastation
Alas£¡
Two loving souls by death cruelly parted
In madness and grief, a dark path started
Calamity was drawn, rituals subverted
But by her cold steel was death averted
Mortal ties broken, with the adepti she went
Their abiding place filling paternal bonds rent
To her red strings of binding they sent
And they dwell long together, content
The crane returned to a home without luster
The cobwebs overgrown, the grave-shrouds a-fluster
But one bond upon her
This world could not muster
Thus does the Divine Damsel's tale duly end
But today a new tale I have to append
Which I shall now tell -- if you shall attend
From the world she seems apart
But there are those who know her heart
With crimson spear and flashing brand
To still the raging tides they stand
The crane once returned
And once, she was spurned
She turned, and left alone
Now, she might be found
With friends all around
To whom she is bound -- a home
