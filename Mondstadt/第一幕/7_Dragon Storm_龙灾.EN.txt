Dragon Storm
The usually peaceful Mondstadt was suddenly assailed by a dragon. This is the Stormterror that Amber spoke of, and was the gigantic creature that you encountered in the forest earlier.
Fend off Stormterror
Amber: Stormterror... is attacking Mondstadt itself!
Amber: Kaeya, 旅行者, you've come at the right time. We must...
Kaeya: Hold on, Amber. Are you perhaps forgetting to introduce us?
Amber: Oh... right. This is Kaeya, our Cavalry Captain.
Amber: These two are travelers from a far 旅行者 and Paimon.
Kaeya: (From afar? Is that all we know of them?)
Amber: Long story short...
Amber tells Kaeya the whole story...
Kaeya: I see. Welcome to Mondstadt C though you haven't arrived at the best of times, I'm afraid.
Kaeya: I understand the anguish of being separated from family.
Kaeya: I'm not really sure why you're looking for the Anemo God...
Kaeya: But everyone has their secrets, right?
Kaeya: Haha, relax! I won't press you for more
Kaeya: First and foremost, on behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I would like to extend our thanks to you for your help just now.
旅行者: Well, we couldn't just leave the situation to fester.
Kaeya: Your fight to defend the city against the dragon just now was witnessed by no small number of citizens.
Kaeya: The Acting Grand Master of the Knightsof Favonius is also very interested in meeting you, and formally invites you both to our headquarters.
Go to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters
Paimon: This seems to be the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. Let's head in.
