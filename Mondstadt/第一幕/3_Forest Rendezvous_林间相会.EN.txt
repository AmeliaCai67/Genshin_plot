Forest Rendezvous
Unexpectedly, the power of Anemo within the Statue of the Seven resonated with you. You decided to begin your investigation with the Anemo Archon of Teyvat's Seven Archons. As such, the first order of the day is to reach the land under the Anemo Archon's protection: Mondstadt.
Go to Mondstadt 
Advance to the heart of the forest
In the heart of the forest, you encounter a mysterious person talking to a dragon. But the interruption sends them both fleeing in haste.
Talk to Paimon
Paimon: That was close! Paimon almost got blown away!
Paimon: Luckily Paimon managed to grab hold of your hair! Thanks.
旅行者: Good thing you didn't pull my hair out.
Paimon: Just what was that? Paimon thought we were gonna get eaten.
Paimon: It definitely has something to do with that weirdo who was talking to the dragon...
旅行者: I can't believe dragons exist in this world...
Paimon: Yeah, Paimon gets why you're worried...
Paimon: Oh? What's that?
Paimon: There's some kind of shiny red thing on the big rock over there...
Paimon: Let's go take a closer look.
Investigate what Paimon has found
Paimon: Be careful! Paimon doesn't have a good feeling about this...
Talk to Paimon
Paimon: Paimon's never seen a stone like this before, so Paimon can't tell what it is.
Paimon: All Paimon knows is that it's dangerous. Best we put it away for now.
Paimon: Okay, we've got it! Now let's get out of here.
