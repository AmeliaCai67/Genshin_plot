Winds of the Past
To stop Stormterror's siege, you must venture out and eliminate the elemental flows left within the ruined Temples of the Four Winds. Amber is waiting for you at the Temple of the Falcon.
Meet Amber at the temple
Talk to Amber
Amber: This is it. One of the deserted temples of The Four Winds.
Amber: These temples have been left to waste for years now. The people of Mondstadt almost never come here.
Amber: There's a chance there s a monster nest or a hilichurl camp inside.
Amber: Even Stormterror has given up on its own temple.
旅行者: "Stormterror..."?
Amber: ... Yes.
Amber: I also find it hard to accept, but...Stormterror was once one of The Four Winds.
Paimon: Ehhhh!?
Amber: Wait... Did you just feel that?
Amber: The wind here... Something's off..
Amber: Let's go in and take a look, 旅行者. Be careful, the dragon's power is disturbing this area.
Enter the temple
Explore the temple's depths
Destroy Stormterror's crystal in the Temple of the Falcon
Amber: Phew, I'm tired.
Amber: But, at least this way we've helped lean out.
Amber: In the past, we were at least able to defend the city and keep it safe.
Amber: This, of course, is mostly thanks to Jean.
Amber: But now with Stormterror directly attacking the city itself...
Amber: "The winds change, so too should our tactics."
旅行者: Sounds deep.
Amber: It's what Lisa likes to say.
Amber: Speaking of which, The Four Winds we were discussing earlier...
Amber: If you want to learn more about our history, you can ask Lisa.
Amber: ...I'm not saying I don't know our history! It's just...
Amber: I mean... A librarian is supposed to be more knowledgeable than an Outrider, right?
