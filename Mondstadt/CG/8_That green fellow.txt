That green fellow

What is to be sung transpired in days of yore
When the divine archons still walked the earth
A dragon cast his curious gaze on the world below
As he parted from the heavens that gave his birth
The dragon sought truth amongst common folk
But mortal trifles only fogged his mind
The windborne bard strummed his strings dolce
And the Holy Lyre answered his questions kind
The dragon was but a child full of wonder
And soared the heavens free from care
The bard’s songs invited him to sing along
For he yearned to let all perceive him fair
Enchanting legends the bard and dragon were
But the tides of despair soon engulfed the land
The lion fang perished and the falcon flag slept
As a vile dragon approached Mondstadt in lone stand
Over the Cathedral loomed death and his friends
Of the people’s agony the bard soon sang
The soaring dragon heeded his grave calls
And amidst the windstorms a brutal war sprang
Blood of venom sent the sky dragon into slumber
Only to awake to be expelled in abhor
“Why do people in this age loathe me so?”
But the Holy Lyre replied no more
Wrath and woe, vigor and venom
Poured from the dragon’s bitter eyes 
The dragon’s curse sprawled in silence
But the Lyre could no longer soothe his cries
