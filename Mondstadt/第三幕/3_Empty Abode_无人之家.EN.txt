Empty Abode
Assailed by many enemies, you realize that this road will not be an easy one. The way into Stormterror's Lair is strewn with obstacles, and so you must proceed with caution to find a path along the ruined walls.
Enter Stormterror's Lair
Paimon: Looks like this is the front gate to Stormterror's Lair.
Paimon: The gate is enormous compared to us... But still, Paimon wonders how Dvalin gets in there with a body that huge?
Venti: He doesn't walk in, he flies in.
Paimon: ...Oh. Hmm, you do have a point.
Go towards Stormterror's Lair
Paimon: It's stuck.
Venti: It's stuck
Paimon: Hey, check out that roof. ls there a giant hole in it?
Venti: Hmm... I suppose we could make use of that wind current
Paimon: Let's make a detour then. Heading up!
Venti: Let's make a detour then. Heading up!
Enter the tower
Paimon: Hmm... Do you think there will be Abyss Mages hiding in the ruins?
Paimon: Either way, if we do run into one, we will let the victorious Master Diluc do the?
Diluc: Do not underestimate them just because I have beaten one of them before.
Diluc: I'm not boasting. I'm simply saying there is more to the Abyss Order than a few mages.
Venti: Correct. That's why I tagged along, after all.
Venti: Well, that - and also for your safety.
Venti: Ah, why am I so diligent? Too diligent for a poet, in fact!
Paimon: So says the person that made zero effort to search for the dragon tears and drank in the tavern all day!
Paimon: Paimon doesn't get it, what part of you is remotely diligent?
Paimon: Look! A wind current.
Paimon: It might lead us to the top of the tower
Find a way through the wind barrier
Go to the up current
Look for a way to the top of the tower
Enter the tower
Go towards the top of the tower
