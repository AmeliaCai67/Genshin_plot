Hurdle
You came to Stormterror's Lair to once again attempt Dvalin's rescue. However, itis surrounded by wind barriers made by Stormterror, and the dark forces at work have no intention of letting you break through those barriers so easily.
Go to the entrance of Stormterror's Lair
Paimon: It's a storm barrier!
Paimon: It looks so dangerous...
Venti: Let me at it.
Venti: Although this wooden lyre is all I have...
Venti: I don't need the lyre to break through this kind of storm barri- Ah wait, what is that?
Jean: Enemy attack! Prepare yourselves:
Defeat the assailants
Venti: The stage will need to be cleared before I can begin my performance.
Venti: Generally speaking, such chores are not the concerns of the performer himself...
Jean: Wait. What's going on? Something's not right.
Jean: There shouldn't be any hilichurl camps in the vicinity of Stormterror's Lair...
Disperse the wind barrier
Venti: Ahh...
Venti: The hilichurls usually do not venture into areas with high elemental concentrations.
Venti: It puts a heavy burden on their bodies
Diluc: The Abyss Order must be manipulating them behind the scenes, yet they shouldn't have been able to determine that we would come.
Diluc: They're presumably spreading their forces to halt our plans.
Venti: Without further ado...
Venti: I suppose I can play faster if my only audience is the wind.
Paimon: It actually opened! You're not entirely useless, Tone-Deaf Bard!
Jean: This is it. We are now entering Stormterror's Lair.
Jean: Watch yourselves. Let's move.
