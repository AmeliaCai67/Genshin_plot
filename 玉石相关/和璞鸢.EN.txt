Primordial Jade Winged-Spear

A jade polearm made by the archons, capableof slaying ancient beasts.

At Liyue's foundation, monsters and gods still ruled the seas.
In fear the forebears lived, and fought the sea with all theycould muster.

As spring turned to fall and back again for many an eon, abehemoth arose that dominated the seas.
Even the Geo Archon's Geo Whale could not triumph against it.

The people of Liyue called it "Baqiu," a beast without rival evenin the deepest depths of the ocean abyss.
lts enormous waves would wash away entire settlements.

So the Geo Archon fashioned a black kite by hand with jade andstones.

The stone bird took to the unbound skies once forged.
Into the heart of the ocean it dove, into the battlefield with thebehemoth and the whale.
Into the depths of the sea the behemoth sank, there to stayforever.
Released from its thundering roars were the people of Liyue.
